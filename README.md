This program calculates how much time your CPU takes to compute n digits of PI using Chudnovsky Algorithm
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm) and n prime numbers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)
and uses the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library for most of the computations.

Compile using `make`.
